# CoCreateFund_FHE

**CoCreateFund_FHE** is an anonymous, privacy-preserving platform for public space co-creation and funding. Citizens can submit proposals for public space improvements in an encrypted and anonymous manner, and FHE-based quadratic funding determines which initiatives receive support. This platform fosters democratic urban development while safeguarding participant privacy.

---

## Project Overview

Traditional civic participation and funding mechanisms often face multiple challenges:

* **Privacy Risks:** Contributors may hesitate to submit ideas or donations due to fear of exposure.
* **Centralized Influence:** Platform administrators or third parties can manipulate or bias proposal selection.
* **Limited Community Engagement:** Ordinary citizens may lack secure channels to participate meaningfully.
* **Non-transparent Allocation:** Funding decisions are often opaque, undermining trust.

**CoCreateFund_FHE** addresses these challenges by applying **fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)**. It allows the system to process contributions and determine funded projects without ever decrypting sensitive user data.

## Key Features

### Proposal Submission

* Users submit proposals for public space improvements anonymously
* Proposals are encrypted on the client side before submission
* Flexible categorization for different types of urban projects

### Quadratic Funding

* FHE-based quadratic funding ensures fair distribution of resources
* Contributions remain encrypted throughout computation
* Mitigates influence of large donors while amplifying community support

### Privacy and Security

* Fully Homomorphic Encryption keeps all submissions confidential
* No personal identifiers are linked to proposals or donations
* Encrypted computation guarantees secure aggregation and funding allocation

### Community Engagement

* Anonymous dashboards display proposals and their funding status
* Citizens can view aggregated support without exposing individual contributions
* Facilitates democratic decision-making in urban development

## How FHE is Applied

1. **Proposal Encryption:** Users encrypt proposals and donation amounts locally.
2. **Encrypted Aggregation:** The platform aggregates contributions and computes quadratic funding scores on encrypted data.
3. **Funding Computation:** FHE ensures allocation calculations are performed without exposing individual data.
4. **Result Decryption:** Only the final funding outcomes are decrypted for public display, keeping individual inputs confidential.

**Benefits:**

* Protects donor and proposer anonymity
* Allows fair and secure community-driven decision-making
* Prevents manipulation of votes and contributions
* Supports regulatory compliance for data privacy

## Architecture

### Client Application

* **Platform:** Web and mobile apps for submitting proposals and contributions
* **Encryption:** FHE applied before data leaves the client device
* **UI:** Interactive dashboards for proposal browsing and contribution tracking
* **Multi-language Support:** Ensures accessibility to diverse communities

### Backend Computation

* **Encrypted Aggregation Engine:** Computes proposal scores and funding allocations securely
* **Quadratic Funding Module:** Implements FHE-based funding algorithm
* **Secure Storage:** Encrypted database stores proposals and contributions

### Data Flow

1. Users encrypt proposals and contributions locally.
2. Encrypted data sent to backend computation engine.
3. FHE-based quadratic funding calculations executed.
4. Final funding results decrypted and displayed on public dashboard.

## Why FHE Matters

FHE enables **CoCreateFund_FHE** to process sensitive proposals and contributions in a fully encrypted manner. Unlike traditional systems, which require access to raw data, FHE ensures:

* Absolute anonymity for citizens
* Secure and fair funding computations
* Transparent, trustable allocation without exposing contributors
* Supports democratic urban development while preserving privacy

---

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers, civic tech enthusiasts, and cryptography researchers:
